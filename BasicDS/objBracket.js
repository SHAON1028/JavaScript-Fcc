// Bracket notation is required if your property has a space in it or if you want to use a variable to name the property. In the above case, the property is enclosed in quotes to denote it as a string and will be added exactly as shown. Without quotes, it will be evaluated as a variable and the name of the property will be whatever value the variable is. Here's an example with a variable:

// const eyes = 'eye color';

// tekkenCharacter[eyes] = 'brown';
// After adding all the examples, the object will look like this:

// {
//   player: 'Hwoarang',
//   fightingStyle: 'Tae Kwon Doe',
//   human: true,
//   origin: 'South Korea',
//   'hair color': 'dyed orange',
//   'eye color': 'brown'
// };


// We've defined a function, checkInventory, which receives a scanned item as an argument. Return the current value of the scannedItem key in the foods object. You can assume that only valid keys will be provided as an argument to checkInventory.

let foods = {
    apples: 25,
    oranges: 32,
    plums: 28,
    bananas: 13,
    grapes: 35,
    strawberries: 27
  };
  
  function checkInventory(scannedItem) {
    // Only change code below this line
  return foods[scannedItem]
    // Only change code above this line
  }
  
  console.log(checkInventory("apples"));
